# PopPanel

PopPanel is a WinUI3 component that acts like a collapsible Panel, but it will automatically animate the transition
between the expanded and collapsed state.

## Features

- automatically sizes itself to fit the content
- once fully collapsed it will disable user input to the content
- can slide in/out in all four directions
- configurable animation duration

 # Screen capture
(never mind the gif capture quality, the animation looks much smoother in the app itself)
